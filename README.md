# SSP API Client
A short tech assessment for SSP

This is a simple console application made in C# using the .NET framework and the Newtonsoft.JSON nuget package. 
If you clone the repository and compile it in Visual Studio, you should be able to run the application without further effort. You will be prompted to "press any key" once the application is ready to begin, and again before the application shuts down. 

This code is made available for academic purposes.
